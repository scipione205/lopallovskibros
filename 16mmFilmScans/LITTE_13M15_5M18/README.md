# 16mm FILM SCANS by the Lopallovski Bros.

Here we go.

We uploaded either the FullHD telecine, either the 2K scan, of our very first film test.

However, the lab joined two slices of film so you will see:

- the first test was done at Ciak Italia, Rome using one of their ARRI 16SRIII and an ARRI ZEISS Distagon 1.2/12. The film stock was Kodak 7219, probably expired and ruined at that time. The film was exposed on March 13rd 2015 and kept in the freezer since then. Has been then processed on May 2018; Normal exposure.
- the second test has been shot here at the STCL-X, using our Aaton XTR and Angenieux 12-120, on May 5th 2018; normal exposure, and the stock was the very same of the first test (so already expired stock, kept 3 more years in the freezer and then exposed and processed);

Grading and denoise performed in Davinci Resolve Studio 15.

Processing and scan: Augustus Color, Rome.

The Angenieux 12-120 was donated to the Lopallovski Bros. by [Marco Montenegro](https://www.instagram.com/1marcomontenegro/) of Nocturno Films LLC, Las vegas NV - USA.
